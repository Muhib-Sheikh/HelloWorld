## Notes

Some challenges I faced included:
* Installing Android Studio - my file location was wrong but I was able to fix it 
* Getting the emulate setup right - it was opening in the toolbar and I wanted it to popout, looked it up and it was a checkbox in settings
* Connecting my GitHub account to Android Studio - did some research and ended up generating a token to use for login
* getting the correct .gitignore and merging master into main - realized there was a merge conflict so I resolved that then I was able to merge successfully
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
